# TODO

X Add search source from within search results, so looking for another token within the results.  Mimics option 25 on Hawkeye results panels.
X Add search result entry for no results found instead of pop up error 
X Running DSPSCNSRC from results view from Hit Line, need to capture basic source reference and then capture the highlighted token for searchText.
x Can we validate the input object reference to the system and type to see if it exists before running hawkeye command?

# COMPLETED
* Need a method to know in the commands.ts for DISPLAY commands that the entry is from the editor text selection and not from the search list. 
* Added token selection from within editor to be feed to Hawkeye commands.
* Check system for Pathfinder install.  Default library name = HAWKEYE.  Could it be installed under another name?
* Add right click options to the search results
* Add top tree level indicating the Hawkeye command used.
* Allow all Hawkeye commands to be used on search result item.
* Added DSPPRCU command
* Result lines are not producing line entry in description
* Result lines are not positioning to source line.
